# Salesforce Financial Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Salesforce's financials to assess key metrics such as revenue growth, profitability, and financial risk. Using Python for data analysis and Excel for financial modeling, the goal is to provide insights into Salesforce's financial health, offering recommendations for long-term investment strategies. The analysis incorporates CAPM for expected return, Monte Carlo simulations for risk analysis, and Prophet for historical trend forecasting.

## Key Insights and Recommendations
- **Revenue Growth:** Salesforce has experienced a 9% Year-over-Year (YoY) revenue growth from FY22 to FY25, reflecting strong market demand and effective sales strategies.
- **Profitability:** With a 22% net margin, Salesforce demonstrates strong operational efficiency, making it a financially viable investment.
- **Debt-to-Equity Improvement:** The 15% improvement in the debt-to-equity ratio indicates improved financial stability, reducing the company's reliance on debt financing.
- **Risk Analysis:** The CAPM model suggests an expected return of 11.3%, while Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 runs indicate a relatively stable risk profile, suggesting a favorable risk-to-reward balance for investors.
- **Long-Term Hold:** Based on the free cash flow (FCF) of $6.2B and strong fundamentals, Salesforce is well-positioned for long-term growth. This supports a recommendation for holding Salesforce stock as a solid investment.

## Tools and Methodology
- **Data Analysis:** Python was used for financial modeling and risk analysis, including CAPM and Monte Carlo simulations.
- **Visualization and Forecasting:** Prophet was employed to conduct historical trend analysis and forecast long-term performance.
- **Dataset:** Salesforce's financial data from FY22â€“FY25, including revenue, net margin, debt-to-equity ratio, and free cash flow.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For financial analysis, risk modeling, and data manipulation.
- **Excel:** For creating financial models and performing detailed calculations.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** For risk analysis and assessing potential financial outcomes.
- **CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model):** Used to calculate expected returns.
- **Prophet:** For time-series forecasting and trend analysis.
