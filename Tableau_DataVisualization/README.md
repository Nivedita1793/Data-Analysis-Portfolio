## Project Overview

This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of vehicle accidents using a publicly available dataset. Through detailed exploration and visualization, the project seeks to uncover relationships and patterns in the data, providing actionable insights into accident frequency, severity, and contributing factors. The results are visualized using **Tableau**, a powerful tool for creating interactive and intuitive dashboards.

## Objectives

1. **Accident Frequency and Severity**:
   - Analyze spatial and temporal patterns in accident occurrences.
   - Investigate factors influencing accident severity and frequency.

2. **Contributing Factors**:
   - Identify common causes of road accidents, including weather conditions, road types, vehicle types, and driver behavior.

3. **Trends in Accidents**:
   - Examine variations in accident occurrences by time of day, day of the week, and month of the year.

4. **Regional Insights**:
   - Compare accident characteristics such as severity and casualty numbers across different regions or jurisdictions.
